# Run Modifiers
"Run Modifiers" are what make runs different.

They are a vehicle for procedural-generation in lootplot.

NOTE:
`Modifiers` are just regular items, with UNIQUE rarity!!!!

The "Default" modifier is the `painter` modifier.
This provides plenty of basic world-generation.

(Think of the `Painter-item` as a configuration for world-generation.)


### IDEA:
By default, modifiers should float.
Ie have `canItemFloat = true`.
That would be cool, and make it look mystical / special 



# Custom-gamemode ideas:

- Challenge mode: 
Enemies spawn frequently. Point requirements increased.

- Golden-spoon mode:
Excess points are converted to money at the end of the round.
Items and slots drain money each round.
