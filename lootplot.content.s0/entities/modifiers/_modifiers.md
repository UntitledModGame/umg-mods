# Run Modifiers
"Run Modifiers" are what make runs different.

They are a vehicle for procedural-generation in lootplot.

NOTE:
`Modifiers` are just regular items, with UNIQUE rarity!!!!

The "Default" modifier is the `painter` modifier.
This provides plenty of basic world-generation.

(Think of the `Painter-item` as a configuration for world-generation.)


### IDEA:
By default, the `painter` should float.
Ie have `canItemFloat = true`.
That would be cool, and make it look mystical / special
