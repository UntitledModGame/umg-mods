```lua


-- defines a `shooter` item:
ent.shooter = {
    mode = 1, -- use mode
    projectileType = "my_projectile", -- projectile entity type

    -- alternatively, we can define a `spawnProjectile` function:
    spawnProjectile = function(holderEnt, gunEnt, i)
        -- `i` is the projectile number.
        return entities.my_projectile()
        -- This entity will be given the appropriate velocity, position,
        -- dimension values by the system.
    end,

    speed = 20, -- speed of projectiles
    count = 1, -- num fired

    -- 0 = fully accurate
    -- math.pi = bullets may change direction by up to 90 degrees!!!
    inaccuracy = 0,

    -- Spread of projectiles, used if multiple are shot.
    -- angle in radians.
    spread = math.pi/4,

    -- the distance away that the projectiles spawn at
    startDistance = 20,

    --[[
        TODO: Put more stuff here afterwards.

    ]]

        -- custom logic here

TODO: This should do a shared projection to `shooter`

gun component that provides a bunch of sensible defaults.
Also plays a default sound, and emits default particles.
Afterwards, provides a bunch of default sounds/particles to choose from.

### PLANNING:

We want:
- multiple projectiles
    - variation / random number of projectiles?
    - min/max number?

- accuracy 
    - min/max spread? 
    - question for getting accuracy? (i.e less accurate when moving)

- projectile directions for multiple projectiles
    - (eg triple shot in b-of-isaac)

- types of projectile entities
I.e. what type of projectile are we shooting?
    - randomized projectile entities?
    - question for getting projectile entity type
^^ The difficulty with this one is that we need 2-way communication.
So... perhaps a `collect` reducer is best for this...? idk.


- projectile velocity
    - question for projectile velocity?
        - do we need the projectile ent for the question...?
