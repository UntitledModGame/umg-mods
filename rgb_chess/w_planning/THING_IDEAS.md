# SPELL_IDEAS



### CARD IDEAS:
ALL OF THESE ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE.

Cool theme idea with card suits:<br>
Hearts, Diamonds:  Regular plays. Basic stuff like rerolling, buffing
Spades, Clubs:  Creative plays, rule bending, meta/introspective behaviour


- `0 of clubs`: Removes [color] from all shop cards
- `2 of clubs`: Set all shop cards to be [color]
- `4 of clubs`: Adds [color] to all shop cards


- `10 of clubs`: All [color] shop cards go half price
- `10 of spades`: Reroll all cards, and set all rerolls to [color]

- `joker`: if there are no [color] units on board, give 6 rerolls. Else, give 2 rerolls.


- `ace_of_diamonds`: give +2 POW to all [color] allies
- `ace_of_hearts`: give +3 HP to all [color] allies
- `ace_of_spades`: shuffle POW stats between [color] allies
- `ace of clubs`: shuffle HP stats between [color] allies

- `full_suit_card`: Swap HP and POW of all [color] allies



**CARDS BELOW THIS LINE ARE "ADVANCED", or more complicated:**

- `blank_card`: If the last card played is [color], replace all shop slots with copies of that card. 
    Else, replace only one slot.

- `duplicate_card`: copy the last card's effects as [color]
- `flipped_duplicate_card`: copy the last card's effects as the inverse of [color]


THESE CARDS SHOULD BE VERY RARE:
- `face_down_card`: Shuffle ability actions of all [color] allies
- `face_down_dark_card`: Shuffle ability triggers of all [color] allies
- `face_down_OTHER_card`: Transfer abilities from non-[color] allies to [color] allies
^^^ todo, we haven't done the art for this
- `face_down_rainbow_card`: Shuffle ability triggers of all allies


Jack cards are related to levels:
- `jack_of_diamonds`: Level up all [color] allies
- `jack_of_hearts`: Set the minimum level of [color] allies to 3
- `jack_of_spades`: Reset [color] ally levels to 1, and gain triple the lost levels in income
- `jack_of_clubs`: Reset [color] ally levels to 1, and gain double the lost levels in rerolls


Queen cards are related to abilities:
- `queen_of_diamonds_card`: Double the max-activations of abilities for [color] allies
- `queen_of_hearts_card`: Instantly proc the abilities of [color] allies
- `queen_of_clubs_card`: Reset ability activations for [color] allies
- `queen_of_spades_card`: Swap abilities between two random [color] allies


King cards are related to items:
- `king_of_hearts_card`: Spawn 2 [color] items
- `king_of_diamonds_card`: Spawn 3 non-[color] items
- `king_of_spades_card`: Delete the lowest health [color] ally. In return, gain 4 [color] items
- `king_of_clubs_card`: Activate all [color] passive items


- `null_card`: Subtract [color] from a random [color] ally


### SPELL IDEAS:
- Give a [color] unit 5 hp
- Change the color of all [color] units
- Reroll all items that are held by [color] units
- Subtract [color] from all units  (e.g. subtract BLU from AQU, becomes GRN)
- Deletes a random [color] ally and gives 3 [color] items
- Swap HP and DMG of a random [color] ally.


### UNIT IDEAS:
Obviously, we will have the basic units:
- Swarm, Tanky, Ranged, Bruiser, Mage.

*Here are some more unique ideas:*

- On level up:  Copy the health of the strongest [color] ally
- Start battle: Instantly kill all non-[color] allys
- Turn start: If there are no [color] allys, gain +3 income
- Turn start: If there are no [color] allys, gain 2 rerolls
- Turn start: If there are no [color] allys, give allies +15% power
- On reroll: If there are only [color] allys, gain +1/+1 
- Turn start: If won previous battle, spawn a random [color] item
- Turn start:  If there are only [color] allys, gain 1 reroll
- Turn end: if there are at least 4 [color] allys, give [color] allys +1/+1
- On buy: mimic the health of the healthiest [color] ally
- On ally summon: if ally is [color], invert ally color
- On ally death: if ally is [color], gain 20% of ally's damage
- On death: remove [color] from all allys
- On ally change color: if ally is [color], mimic the healthiest [color] ally
- On ally summon: If there are only [color] units, give ally a random item
- Turn start: If there are no [color] allys, gain 50% HP. Else, lose 50% HP.
- On buff: If buff type is HP, give all [color] allys +1 DMG

- Backpack unit, Has a very large inventory space
- Reroller, Start of turn: rerolls the color of all items in inventory 

- On buy:  Swap the abilities of the two healthiest [color] allys

- On buy: If the last bought unit is [color], all non-[color] allys inherit that ability. Else, inherit that ability.


# PARAGON UNITS:
Only show up in the shop after turn 6.
There is a maximum of 1 paragon unit for each army.

- SAIYO:  Turn start:  Steals 10% HP from all non-[color] units
- KYU:  Turn start:  Steals 10% POW from all non-[color] units
- CELESTION:  On buy: copies all abilities from [color] units
- MYTHRUNE:  Has 36 inventory slots. Turn start: Gives 4 free [color] items
- ZEPHYR:  During battle, mimic all [color] unit abilities when they apply
- HIVESWARM:  On buy:  Duplicates all [color] units with 70% stat reduction


### ITEM IDEAS:
Most items can only be given to a unit if they are the same color.
(AQU,MAG,YLO items are much more common to compensate.)
There are also some items that can be given regardless of color.

**Passive items**
- Start turn: give +1 income
- Give 5% lifesteal
- Start battle: give +15% health
- Start battle: give +15% damage
- Start battle: give 20% hp shield
- End turn: give +2 power
- On reroll: give +1 HP

- End of turn: unit becomes color [color], and this item is consumed
- End of turn: unit gets [color] removed, and this item is consumed
- Start battle: unit becomes [color]
- Start of turn:  If there are no [color] allies, give +2 income
- On death: Revive 2 copies of this unit, and delete this item

etc. BE MORE CREATIVE!!! More items like the above ones.
We want the items to be meshing with their own rules as much as possible.


**Weapon items**
- Battleaxe, gives melee splash damage
- Dagger, x2 damage to melee unit

**Magic items**
These are only usable by units with high enough `power`. 
- Leaf staff, shields the strongest ally
- Basic staff, deals damage equal to 100% power
- Splash staff, deals splash damage equal to 20% power
- Heal staff, heals the ally with the most missing health
- Heal splash staff, splash heals allies
- Moon staff, heals allies for 5% of their health
- Kinetic staff, uses all other [color] staffs in the inventory
- Rock staff, stuns and deals damage


















# UNIT NAME IDEAS:


QUICK RECAP:
We aren't drawing the units here,
we are drawing an easily-identifyable symbol for them.
The symbols should ideally be simple, and easy to distinguish.


- Tanky unit
Tank unit, strong and blocky

- Goblin
Small annoying unit

- Dice unit
This unit rerolls stuff. (We probably want a dice for this image)

- Wizard unit
Maybe a wizard hat? :-)

- Brute
Looks like the player off PushOps

- Slug swarm unit
(something that looks like the one I posted before maybe?)

- Pig unit
perhaps a pig face for this could be good?

- Money unit; generates money
Perhaps a coin symbol for this?

- Visionary unit
A giant eye symbol would be really cool for this unit.
This unit is basically a "support" unit

- Shield mage unit
This unit creates magic shields for allies
