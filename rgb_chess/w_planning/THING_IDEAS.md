# SPELL_IDEAS



### SPELL IDEAS:
- Change the color of all non-[color] shop cards
- If you have no [color] units, gain 3 gold
- Give a [color] unit 5 hp
- Change the color of all [color] units
- Reroll all items that are held by [color] units
- Subtract [color] from all units  (e.g. subtract BLU from AQU, becomes GRN)
- Deletes a random [color] ally and gives 3 [color] items
- Swap HP and DMG of a random [color] ally.


### UNIT IDEAS:
Obviously, we will have the basic units:
- Swarm, Tanky, Ranged, Bruiser, Mage.

*Here are some more unique ideas:*

- Start battle:  Instantly kill all non-[color] allys
- Turn start:  If there are no [color] allys, gain +3 income
- On reroll: If there are only [color] allys, gain +1/+1 
- On win round:  Spawn a random [color] item
- Turn start:  If there are only [color] allys, give a free reroll
- Turn end: if there are at least 4 [color] allys, give [color] allys +1/+1
- On buy: mimic the health of the healthiest [color] ally
- On ally summon: if ally is [color], invert ally color
- On ally death: if ally is [color], gain 20% of ally's damage
- On death: remove [color] from all allys
- On ally change color: if ally is [color], mimic the healthiest [color] ally
- On ally summon: If there are only [color] units, give ally a random item
- Turn start: If there are no [color] allys, gain 50% HP. Else, lose 50% HP.

- Backpack unit, Has a very large inventory space
- Reroller, Start of turn: rerolls the color of all items in inventory 



### ITEM IDEAS:
Most items can only be given to a unit if they are the same color.
(However, AQU,MAG,YLO items are much more common to compensate.)
There are also some items that can be given regardless of color.

**Passive items**
- Start turn: give +1 income
- Give 5% lifesteal
- Start battle: give +15% health
- Start battle: give +15% damage
- Start battle: give 20% hp shield
- End turn: give +2 Sorcery

- End of turn: unit becomes color [color], and this item is consumed
- End of turn: unit gets [color] removed, and this item is consumed
- Start battle: unit becomes [color]
- Start of turn:  If there are no [color] allies, give +2 income
- On death: Revive 2 copies of this unit, and delete this item

etc. BE MORE CREATIVE!!! More items like these above three.
We want the items to be meshing with their own rules as much as possible.


**Weapon items**
- Battleaxe, gives melee splash damage
- Dagger, x2 damage to melee unit

**Magic items**
These are only usable by units with high enough `Sorcery`. 
- Leaf staff, shields the strongest ally
- Basic staff, deals damage equal to 100% Sorcery-Points
- Splash staff, deals splash damage equal to 20% Sorcery-Points
- Heal staff, heals the ally with the most missing health
- Heal splash staff, splash heals allies
- Moon staff, heals allies for 5% of their health
- Kinetic staff, uses all other [color] staffs in the inventory
- Rock staff, stuns and deals damage
