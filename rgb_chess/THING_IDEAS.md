# SPELL_IDEAS



### SPELL IDEAS:
- Change the color of all non-[color] shop cards
- If you have no [color] units, gain 3 gold
- Give a [color] unit 5 hp
- Change the color of all [color] units
- Reroll all items that are held by [color] units
- Subtract [color] from all units  (e.g. subtract BLU from AQU, becomes GRN)




### UNIT IDEAS:
Obviously, we will have the basic units:
- Swarm, Tanky, Ranged, Bruiser, Mage.

*Here are some more unique ideas:*

- Start battle:  Instantly kill all non-[color] units
- Turn start:  If there are no [color] units, gain +3 income
- On reroll: If there are only [color] units, gain +1/+1 
- On win round:  Spawn a random [color] item
- Turn start:  If there are only [color] units, give a free reroll
- Turn end: give all [color] allys +1/+1

- Backpack unit, Has a very large inventory space
- Reroller, Has inventory ui, allowing to reroll items. 2 items = 1 reroll



### ITEM IDEAS:
Most items can only be given to a unit if they are the same color.
(However, AQU,MAG,YLO items are much more common to compensate.)
There are also some items that can be given regardless of color.

**Passive items**
- Start turn: give +1 income
- Give 5% lifesteal
- Start battle: give +15% health
- Start battle: give +15% damage
- Start battle: give 20% hp shield
- End turn: give +2 Mana power

- End of turn: unit becomes color [color], and this item is consumed
- End of turn: unit gets [color] removed, and this item is consumed
- Start battle: unit becomes [color]

etc. BE MORE CREATIVE!!! More items like these above three.
We want the items to be meshing with their own rules as much as possible.


**Weapon items**
- Battleaxe, gives melee splash damage
- Leaf staff, shields the strongest ally
- Dagger, x2 damage to melee unit
- Merchant staff,
