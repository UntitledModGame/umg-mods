# Auto chess, just like legends of runeterra.


--> standard auto-chess mechanics:

Rerollable / lockable shops, like Super Auto Pets

Interest on money

Units will battle automatically

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Place your units on a chess board, (similar to how legends of runeterra does it.)



# gameplay:
```
Buy / shop phase:
    Reroll shop
    buy stuff from shop
    reorder cards
    etc.

Fight bots:
    Fight against bot units, get coins for how many you kill.

Fight players:
    Fight against other players.
```



# cards:

## card colors:
There are 3 "colors" of cards:
`red`, `green`, and `blue`.
The colors don't really tell anything about the card- however, colors
limit what kind of stuff you can do with cards.

For example, if you have a red-colored upgrade card, it only works on units
with a red color.

Some cards can have multiple colors. 

For example, 
- `aqua` cards have both `blue` and `green` color.
- `yellow` cards have both `red` and `green` color.
- `white` cards have all colors.


For the first 3 rounds, only red,blue,green cards are available.
On the 4th round, the color chances are as follows:

color chances:
```
Each card spawns with a color. Here are the chances:
28% chance of red
28% chance of blue
28% chance of green
5% chance of aqua (green + blue)
5% chance of yellow (red + green)
5% chance of magenta (red + blue)
1% chance of white (all)
```




## card upgrading:
Cards of the same type can be "combined" to buff the stats. 
(Similar to super auto pets.)
You can only combine cards that share a common color and are same type.



### units
Tanks - not much dmg, big hp
Fighters - decent dmg, decent hp
Ranged - decent dmg, not much hp
Swarm unit - decent dmg and decent hp in total- (spawns multiple in a group)
Summoner - spawns other units
Utility -
    Healers (only heals units of the same color)
    coin generators
    units that allow cheaper shops / more rerolls, etc.
    debuffers
    buffers  (only buffs units of the same color)
    ETC, ETC.


### Summoner  
Spawns units over time.
The color of the spawner will determine the color of the units spawned.

NOTE: Applying an upgrade to a summoner SHOULD NOT buff the units inside!



### Upgrade cards
Cards that provide a permanent upgrade to one or more units.
Each upgrade card has a `color`, which determines which other cards it works on.

#### List of upgrades:
- Ground slam: For all [x] colored melee units on the board, gain AOE attack
- Shopper: increases shop size by 1
- Ranger token: All [x] colored ranged units have their DMG doubled
- Flat DMG: All [x] colored units on the board gain (a flat amount of) HP
- flat HP: All [x] colored units on the board gain (a flat amount of) DMG
- Damage bully: Increased an [x] colored unit's DMG based on it's health
- Pop buff: Your board gains 1 unit slot
- Universal-color: Converts a card to White color
- Aqua card: Converts an [x] colored card to Aqua color
- Magenta card: Converts an [x] colored card to Magenta color
- Yellow card: Converts an [x] colored card to Yellow color
- Reroll card: Reroll the color of all [X] colored units
- Unishop: Converts all unfrozen shop cards to [x] color
- Swappity: Swaps HP and DMG of an [x] colored unit



## EMERGENT FEATURES:::::
Super Auto Pets is a great example of a game that does Emergence really well.
For example, fainting, summoning, and buying are all mechanics that SAP
takes advantage of.
Its done very well, because the mechanics are all really easy to understand,
yet can still bring some VERY interesting combos into play.

Make sure when you do emergent features, don't only focus on in-battle stuff.
You could do other stuff as well, such as:
Shop is rerolled --> This unit permanently gains +1 HP, +1 DMG
Unit of the same color is purchased --> gain 20% of the purchased unit's HP and DMG





### Feature 1: Stuns:
One example of cool combo could be stuns:

CARD 1:
This unit stuns enemy units every 3rd attack

OTHER CARDS THAT HAVE EMERGENCE WITH THIS:
Enemy unit is stunned --> heal 5% of HP
Enemy unit is stunned --> Take 40% reduced damage for this round



## ANOTHER GOOD IDEA:
There needs to be some cases of opposite-color cards synergizing with each other.
For example:

Hog-Brute:
Start of round,
Steals 10% of ally unit's stats that are diff color








# Future ideas:

Bloons TD 5 and 6 do great examples of upgrading.
Upgrade paths are unique, and are fun to discover.

Perhaps cards can be upgraded in this fashion too?
