     * Different types of per-pixel stencil test and depth test comparisons.
     *
     * The pixels of an object will be drawn if the comparison succeeds, for
     * each pixel that the object touches.
     *
     * *equal*
     * - stencil tests: the stencil value of the pixel must be equal to the
     *   supplied value.
     * - depth tests: the depth value of the drawn object at that pixel must be
     *   equal to the existing depth value of that pixel.
     *
     * *notequal*
     * - stencil tests: the stencil value of the pixel must not be equal to the
     *   supplied value.
     * - depth tests: the depth value of the drawn object at that pixel must not
     *   be equal to the existing depth value of that pixel.
     *
     * *less*
     * - stencil tests: the stencil value of the pixel must be less than the
     *   supplied value.
     * - depth tests: the depth value of the drawn object at that pixel must be
     *   less than the existing depth value of that pixel.
     *
     * *lequal*
     * - stencil tests: the stencil value of the pixel must be less than or
     *   equal to the supplied value.
     * - depth tests: the depth value of the drawn object at that pixel must be
     *   less than or equal to the existing depth value of that pixel.
     *
     * *gequal*
     * - stencil tests: the stencil value of the pixel must be greater than or
     *   equal to the supplied value.
     * - depth tests: the depth value of the drawn object at that pixel must be
     *   greater than or equal to the existing depth value of that pixel.
     *
     * *greater*
     * - stencil tests: the stencil value of the pixel must be greater than the
     *   supplied value.
     * - depth tests: the depth value of the drawn object at that pixel must be
     *   greater than the existing depth value of that pixel.
     *
     * *never*
     * - Objects will never be drawn.
     *
     * *always*
     * - Objects will always be drawn. Effectively disables the depth or stencil
     *   test.
