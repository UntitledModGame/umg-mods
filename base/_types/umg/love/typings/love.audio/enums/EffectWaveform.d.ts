     * | Constant | Description |
     * | :- | :- |
     * | `"sawtooth"` | A sawtooth wave, also known as a ramp wave. Named for its linear rise, and (near-)instantaneous fall along time. |
     * | `"sine"` | A sine wave. Follows a trigonometric sine function. |
     * | `"square"` | A square wave. Switches between high and low states (near-)instantaneously. |
     * | `"triangle"` | A triangle wave. Follows a linear rise and fall that repeats periodically. |
