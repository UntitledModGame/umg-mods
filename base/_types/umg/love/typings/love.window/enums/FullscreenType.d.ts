     * largest display mode.

     * Normal fullscreen mode is sometimes avoided by users because it can cause
     * issues in some window managers and with multi-monitor setups. In OS X it
     * prevents switching to a different program until fullscreen mode is exited. The
     * "desktop" fullscreen mode generally avoids these issues.
