    TODO:
    Create a reuseable script generator here.
    This should be able to be reused by other mods,
    such as worldeditor.

    Put a warning to the user!!! (this could crash client)

    Also allow the user to decide whether it runs on server / client.

    The UI function should return a lua chunk.
