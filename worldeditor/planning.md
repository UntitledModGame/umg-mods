## Pre-planning:
Do we want to allow the game to be running whilst the worldeditor is active?
(probably, yes!)

We should just block all input if the client is worldediting







## WORLDEDITOR PLANNING:

Core things in worldediting:



## Selections
Rectangular selection regions





ALL OF THE FOLLOWING SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE IMPORTED / EXPORTED:
## Brushes
Represent a rule that can be applied to a position in the world

## Schematics
Represent groups of entities

## SpawnRule
Spawns an entity
(Example, spawn a grass, set image to random between 1 and 5)

## EditRule
Edits an entity
()




Macros should be deployed by other mods,
or by the worldeditor itself.
(For example, drawing the worldborder is a macro that tags onto the selection)

## Macros
Miscellaneous changes to a world  (e.g. worldborder, player spawn)
