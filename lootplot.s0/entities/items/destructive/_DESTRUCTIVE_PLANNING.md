# DESTRUCTIVE PLANNING:

Destructive-archetype is going to probably be one of the most interesting archetypes in the game.

But it *NEEDS* be be executed well.

---

## We have 3 categories:

- Rocks: Do something when destroyed
(eg. earn points/mult when destroyed)

- Destroyers: Destroy items
(eg. destroy target items, earn $1 for each)

- Garbage: items that have a negative-effect
(eg. Turd-item: steals $1, sticky)

- Spawners: Spawns items
(eg. spawn turd-items. For each turd spawned, earn $3)
(eg.2: spawn rock-items)


----


## The ephemerality issue:
One concern i have is player micromanaging/throwing away rocks.

A big part of "fun" in lootplot is when players get a good build going, and watch it earn tonnes of points.

But... with the destructive-archetype, stuff gets destroyed!
Which means that it is temporary.

Maybe this is fine...? Idk...
i feel like it'd just get annoying tho, and it would make the `destructive` archetype unreliable.

## IDEA / SOLUTION:
What if we made clone-rocks very common, and easy to generate???
- Clone-rock: If item has `Destroy` trigger, transform into it
IE:
An item that spawns clone-rocks.

THAT WOULD BE AWESOME!
that would *ALSO* solve the problem of not being able to buff rocks.
WHICH IS SO COOL.
RAGH. OKAY. AWESOME.
