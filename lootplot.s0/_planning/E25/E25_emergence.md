## EARLY-2025 EMERGENCE DOCUMENT.
HOT TAKE:
Maybe there isn't enough emergence in lootplot.

================================

All lootplot synergies that exist, I (the dev) know about.
This... is very bad.  
The dev shouldn't know about all the existing synergies!!  
That's a sign of insufficient emergence.

----
That being said, though:  
DON'T BE DOGMATIC!!! "Emergence" isn't always good.   
We need to strike a good balance between dev-control and emergence.  
- (Take Balatro for example; Balatro isn't very emergent!!!)

I still think that there aren't enough emergent items, tho.

-----

## IN GENERAL:
We need more "broad" items.
That is, items that can work *no matter the situation.*

GOOD EXAMPLES OF THIS:
- Steak Maker
- Red/Golden shield
- Doomed turnip
- Pie/Glove-items
- Donut items

^^^ Notice how these items generally tag onto 1 mechanic,  
in a highly simple fashion.  
Perhaps our problem is not with the items.. but rather with the mechanics.
