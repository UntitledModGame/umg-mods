## DESTRUCTIVE ITEMS::: SPIKE
These need some planning.  
Brainstorm the systems at play, and the intended playstyles at play.   
(SEE: `_DESTRUCTIVE_PLANNING.md`)  
```
    - ITEM:
    On destroy, generate 5 points 20 times  (great w/ bonus)

    - ITEM:
    On destroy, give +2.5 mult

    - ITEM:
    On destroy, give +200 points. (lives=60, price=-$2)
    (^^^^ I'm imagining the player lining up multiple shovels to proc this item)

    - ITEM: (Golden rocks)
    On Destroy, Rotate: 
    Set mult to 0
    Earn $1

    - ITEM: Clone-rocks
    If target item has DESTROY trigger, transform into it
    (^^^ THIS SHOULD BE UNCOMMON!!! this item is an AMAZING idea.)
    (more items like these please)

    - ITEM: Green rock:
    On Reroll, Destroy:
    Gives +3 bonus
    Gives +0.4 mult
    Steals 10 points

    - ITEM: Crimson rocks
    On Reroll, Destroy:
    Add mult equal to the current balance

    - ITEM: Muddy rocks
    On Rotate, Destroy:
    Add +0.5 mult
    Add +10 bonus
    (GRUB-10)

    - ITEM: Orange rock:
    On Rotate, Destroy:
    Earn +40 points
    Adds +1 mult
    Steals -2 bonus

    - ITEM: Anchor rock
    On Destroy:
    Set bonus to 0
    Earn 90 points

    - ITEM: Rock printer
    Adds +0.5 mult. Spawn clone-rocks. (shape=ABOVE-2)
```




## (SPIKE: PLANNING)
- Rework shards to do something else
(Ideally, we want them to *NOT* destroy themselves when used, lmao)


## Slot-destruction-spike:
Destroying slots is a great way to add more strategy as well (synergizes with glass/doomed tiles)    
--   
Perhaps we should consider adding 



## SPIKE:
Pineapple-ring is VERY VERY VERY fun to use.
Let's create more items like that, please!!!
Because It is honestly SO FUN.
Don't worry as much about balance. Just aim for fun. :)




## AETHER ITEMS SPIKE:
It would be cool to do something with these.  
These items look very otherwordly, and can probably be used for something very rule-bendy



## Anti-reroll mechanism SPIKE:
We need more anti-reroll stuff. Or else, reroll-archetype is gonna be ALL-ENCOMPASSING.
---->
One idea is to have items that trigger On-Reroll, and have negative-effects.  
But.... this doesn't really work, since the player can just destroy/remove the items.  
HOWEVER!  
What if we had *SLOTS* that were On-Reroll?  (Paper slot?)
EG:
```
Paper Slot: activates on Reroll
----
examples / opportunities:
Paper Slot: DOOMED-10  (can only be rerolled 10 times before dead)
Paper Slot: bonusGenerated = -1
Paper Slot: multGenerated = -0.1
Paper Slot: pointsGenerated = -10
Paper Slot: moneyEarned = -0.5
```
^^^ This is an excellent idea!!! :)  
And what's coolest, is that players can even game the system to make it *work WITH* reroll-archetype  
(ie by using mushrooms to buff the slots)  
---->  
The "hard bit" is deciding how to actually spawn the paper-slots.  
Do some thinking.  Make sure not to overdo it... we dont want to kill reroll-archetype;
we just want to make it a bit less "all-encompassing".
-->> ITEM IDEAS:
```
ITEM: (floaty, doomed-1)
Spawns a paper-slot with a key inside it

ITEM:
Spawns paper-slots.
```
