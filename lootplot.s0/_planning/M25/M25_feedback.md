## MID-2025 FEEDBACK DOC:
(BETA v3.0.2 FEEDBACK)


- Tutorial-cat should be forced onto the player
--> Lock starter items



- Victory-shockwave juice should be better!
--> nemene suggestion: Make victory-shockwave a flat-color: fade looks weird



- Sheepollution: Some items are kinda confusing when beginning
--> Lock items behind metaprogression system


- Sheepollution: Didn't understand treasure-sacks
--> IDEA: Add shapes to sack-items.
--> IDEA: To balance it, make cloud-slots destroy diagonally too. This makes it a lot more balanced for bishop/knight shapes


- Sheeppollution: Didn't understand what "items" and "slots" were.
--> Create tutorial-part explaining items/slots, and that you can move items.


- Sheeppollution: When moving mouse, sometimes item-descriptions get in way
(Maybe add a delay?)
