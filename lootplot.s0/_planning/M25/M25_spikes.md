## M25 SPIKES:


- M25-SPIKE: Make tutorial better:
- Players didnt understand shapes/targetting system well enough



- M25-SPIKE: Rotate items:
I feel like Rotate-items suck a bit, because its always just: "oh, generate more points"
Which is kinda meh and dumb.  We need more *scaling,* if anything.
We should have more rulebending effects on rotate-items. Perfect example of this is copper-plate.


- M25-SPIKE: Reroll items:
I feel like Reroll-archetype doesnt't work very well with mult/bonus.
Probably because a lot of mult/bonus is earned during PULSE;
then, when you go to reroll, it doesn't exist.  
WAYS TO REMEDY THIS:
- More emerald slots (make cucumber UNCOMMON?)
- More basic-slots with both Reroll and Pulse trigger
--->  
- item like Orange-die to bridge gap between Reroll/Pulse (UNCOMMON?)
- Change BOWL item to only trigger on Reroll? And make it Pulse twice maybe
