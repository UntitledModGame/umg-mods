## M25 SPIKES:


- M25-SPIKE: Make tutorial better:
- Players didnt understand shapes/targetting system well enough



- M25-SPIKE: Rotate items:
I feel like Rotate-items suck a bit, because its always just: "oh, generate more points"
Which is kinda meh and dumb.  We need more *scaling,* if anything.
We should have more rulebending effects on rotate-items. Perfect example of this is copper-plate.
