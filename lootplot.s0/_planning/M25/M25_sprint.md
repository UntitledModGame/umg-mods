## MID-2025 SPRINT:


- Make victory-shockwave cleaner, remove fade from it



- Lock starter items (except for tutorial-cat)
- Add unlocks for starter-items (win game)


- plan what items should be unlocked at the start of the game   
    --> rotate items should start locked  
    --> destructive-archetype should probably start locked too?  


- Add item unlock infrastructure
- Make complex items locked at the start of the game
