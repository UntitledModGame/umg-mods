# daily run planning:

Ok. Lets aim to be HYPER pragmatic. 
There's real opportunity to make some super interesting stuff.

## HIGH LEVEL STEPS:

- DETERMINE THE LAYOUT:
- where the shop-slots are, where food-shop-slots are, where reroll-button is
- where the pulse/level button is
- where the main-island is (there should be at least 9 pposes.)
- where the sell-slot(s) are (between 1 and 3 sell-slots)
- where any null-slots are


- Spawn shop

- Spawn main island
- Spawn neutral starting scenario

- Spawn mystery-slots (slots that are unlocked after X activations)

- Spawn randomized curses
