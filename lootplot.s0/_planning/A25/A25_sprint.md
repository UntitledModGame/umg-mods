## After-Release 2025 sprint


- Added trophy/difficulty system

- Added 3 new trophies, bronze, silver, gold

- Added 3 new difficulties; (easy, medium, hard)

- Added some extra stuff to work towards in the tutorial-run.

- Make copper-chestplate locked w/ ROTATE archetype

- When on the final level, it should say "FINAL LEVEL"

- Made books on-pulse, since `read` activate-button was too confusing

- Fixed item-lock being rotated weirdly for rotated items

- Nerfed potions, they were OP with doomed-4

- Nerfed Six-Ball

- Fixed Grammar for hearts card

- Fixed buffing text popup shows numbers at 2dp

- Made buffing-text look nicer

- (HUGE UX IMPROVEMENT) Made keys and sacks activate when placed 

- Fixed the 6-Ball! It used old code for UP-4, Pulse items. Also nerfed the income for 6-ball

- Put synergies in locked-slots for tutorial treasure-bar




## TODO:

- (DONE) Consumable items: When placed, foods should activate *immediately.*

- (DONE) New description-bit: `CONSUMABLE: Activated instantly!`

## WE WILL NEED TO REWORK A BUNCH OF STUFF:
### Make more uses for DOOMED systems, and more uses for lives system
- Rework/remove all kinds of heartfruit(s)
- Add new mineral-items: DOOMED
- Add 2 new DOOMED-10 items so the archetype isn't completely dead

- REWORK TUTORIAL!!! We will need to explain FOOD items, and redo the pomegranate.

- NEW LEGENDARY ITEM: Chef's Knife:
- On Level-Up: Spawns null-slots with food inside them.
- (KNIGHT shape)


- Do SOMETHING about max-activations. Setting it to 5 is just lazy/bad;
we have pineapple-ring, blue-net, grass-item; and tonnes of other items that rely on max-activations




--------------

- Different difficulties- bronze, silver, gold trophies (to implement, create a "DIFFICULTY" property)
trophies should spawn more or less curses (silver trophy, 1 curse per level) (gold trophy 2 curses per level)
And the points requirement should differ too
