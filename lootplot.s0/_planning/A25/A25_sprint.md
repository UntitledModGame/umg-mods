## After-Release 2025 sprint


- Added trophy/difficulty system

- Added 3 new trophies, bronze, silver, gold

- Added 3 new difficulties; (easy, medium, hard)

- Added some extra stuff to work towards in the tutorial-run.

- Make copper-chestplate locked w/ ROTATE archetype

- When on the final level, it should say "FINAL LEVEL"

- Made books on-pulse, since `read` activate-button was too confusing

- Fixed item-lock being rotated weirdly for rotated items

- Nerfed potions, they were OP with doomed-4

- Nerfed Six-Ball

- Fixed Grammar for hearts card

- Fixed buffing text popup shows numbers at 2dp

- Made buffing-text look nicer

- (HUGE UX IMPROVEMENT) Made keys and sacks activate when placed 

- Fixed the 6-Ball! It used old code for UP-4, Pulse items. Also nerfed the income for 6-ball



## TODO:


- Put synergies in locked-slots for tutorial treasure-bar


- Different difficulties- bronze, silver, gold trophies (to implement, create a "DIFFICULTY" property)
trophies should spawn more or less curses (silver trophy, 1 curse per level) (gold trophy 2 curses per level)
And the points requirement should differ too
