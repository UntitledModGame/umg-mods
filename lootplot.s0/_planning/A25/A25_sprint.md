## After-Release 2025 sprint



- Make copper-chestplate locked w/ ROTATE archetype


## TODO:

When on the final level, it should say:
"FINAL LEVEL"
Maybe make the last level like 50% more points or something???

Books "read" button are confusing due to target moving. Make them activate on Pulse instead

Put some extra stuff to accomplish in the tutorial (GREAT IDEA: After level 3, spawn locked-slots, and spawn a key? That would give players something to "work towards")

Add trophy system; players will want to see what they have accomplished

Different difficulties- bronze, silver, gold trophies (to implement, create a "DIFFICULTY" property)
trophies should spawn more or less curses (silver trophy, 1 curse per level) (gold trophy 2 curses per level)
And the points requirement should differ too

FIX: When an item is in the shop, Lock is rotated

FIX: Buffing text popup shows numbers at 2dp. Change it to 1dp, or 0dp if the buff is an integer. (Change to yellow-color too?)

NERF: Potions, they are OP right now with doomed-4

FIX: THE 6-Ball! Its currently still using old code for UP-4, Pulse items.
Also, nerf the income for 6-ball

FIX: Grammar hearts card
