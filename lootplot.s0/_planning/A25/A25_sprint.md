## =============================
## TODO:
## =============================


- FIXED: 2 turnip softlock 
- (IDEA: make it so `footItem`s can only activate once they have been moved?)


- Removed the next-level button, BIG REFACTOR to pulse-button / rounds
---->>>
- Instead, the Pulse-Button BE the next-level button. (including visuals)
- The player should receive $10 for every round completed early.
- (Make sure to buffer the cash, so the player can see how much they get)
"Ok but what about the 9-ball?"
--> the 9 ball should be changed, instead of costing $60 to progress, there should just be a slot somewhere that subtracts $60 on level-up

- Fixed some speling/gramar erors

- New item: GOLDEN FISH: Sets money to -$20, Makes slot earn $1

- New item: BLUE FISH: Set money to -$10, Makes slot earn 8 bonus

- New item: SALMON: ($1) Rotate items. (KING-1 Shape, UNCOMMON)

- Made golden horseshoe be an UNCOMMON food item (as well as non-food)


- Added 3 new trophies, bronze, silver, gold

- Added 3 new difficulties; (easy, medium, hard)

- Added 2 new DOOMED-10 items so the archetype isn't completely dead

- Created Grubby-ball, (G-ball) showcasing grubby-archetype

- Created achievement for grubby-ball

- Made items that can't activate grayscale (need shader)

- CREATED NEW LEGENDARY ITEM: Chef's Knife: 
- On Level-Up: Spawns null-slots with food inside them. (KNIGHT shape)


- Added 2 extra difficulties- bronze, silver, gold trophies (to implement, create a "DIFFICULTY" property)
trophies should spawn more or less curses (silver trophy, 1 curse per level) (gold trophy 2 curses per level)
And the points requirement should differ too
