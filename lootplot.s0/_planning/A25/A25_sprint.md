## =============================
## DONE:
## =============================


- Fixed crash https://discord.com/channels/863625920991854602/1373076077047713843/1373076077047713843


## =============================
## TODO:
## =============================


- Fixed achievements not working

- Automatically select a background in menu (instead of hovering locked)

- Rounding for reroll/pulse rings (balance: $8.348934893)

- UI changes in UMG-CORE: Buttons should have a hover effect. 
- Also, ALL buttons should play a sound when pressed. (In NewRunScreen)

- IDEA: Reduce the number of levels for winning for EASY/NORMAL.
(Maybe easy only requires 6 levels to win...? Normal 8 levels?)



## =============================
## STRETCH / NEXT-SPRINT:
## =============================


- Made items that can't activate grayscale (need shader)

- CREATED NEW LEGENDARY ITEM: Chef's Knife: 
- On Level-Up: Spawns null-slots with food inside them. (KNIGHT shape)


- Different difficulties should spawn more or less curses 
(silver trophy, 1 curse per level) (gold trophy 2 curses per level)

- Create popup text saying "LEVEL {X} PASSED!"
- Play a cool sound when progressing to next level
