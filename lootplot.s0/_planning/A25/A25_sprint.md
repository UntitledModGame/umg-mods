## After-Release 2025 sprint


- Make copper-chestplate locked w/ ROTATE archetype

- When on the final level, it should say "FINAL LEVEL"

- Made books on-pulse, since `read` activate-button was too confusing

- Fixed item-lock being rotated weirdly for rotated items

- Nerfed potions, they were OP with doomed-4

- Fixed Grammar for hearts card

- Added some extra stuff to work towards in the tutorial-run.



## TODO:


- Added trophy system

- Different difficulties- bronze, silver, gold trophies (to implement, create a "DIFFICULTY" property)
trophies should spawn more or less curses (silver trophy, 1 curse per level) (gold trophy 2 curses per level)
And the points requirement should differ too


FIX: Buffing text popup shows numbers at 2dp. Change it to 1dp, or 0dp if the buff is an integer. (Change to yellow-color too?)


FIX: THE 6-Ball! Its currently still using old code for UP-4, Pulse items.
Also, nerf the income for 6-ball
