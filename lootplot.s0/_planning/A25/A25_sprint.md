When curses are spawned randomly, make curses spawn on DOOMED-X slots (that way, player can prepare)

=----------------
DO OUTREACH!!!
=----------------

Make use of mystery-slots somehow




- Make it so stone-hand curses don't spawn curses "randomly";
its confusing and weird.
Instead, spawn them in the location that the curse WILL be.
--> Also, stone-hands should only exist on HARD mode.



## ADD MAIN-MENU MUSIC:
https://youtu.be/s8nkrxzOBR4?feature=shared  NOTABLE SONGS:
~~- Bullet witch~~ (meh, maybe not, too upbeat)

https://backgroundsounds.itch.io/fun-music-loops
(PREVIEW: https://soundcloud.com/bgs_stockaudio/fun-music-loops)
- 1:43 onwards
- 8:14 onwards (menu music?)
- 5:11 onwards (MENU MUSIC!!??)



- Number-keys shortcuts for pressing action-buttons


- Consider adding DOOMED tools? (Purple-color)


- JOJO FEEDBACK:
More items should have adjacency interactions.
(For example axe-items, or scythe-items)
^^^ this is what makes stuff interesting



- Twilight background? Dark black/blue with gray clouds

- Rainbow background? Cool HSV/Oklab
 
- Sunset background? (With proper Oklab shader fade)

- Copycat-rain background: Background with copycats raining down


- More items that interact with curses


## Worldgen ideas:,
- Worldgen slots that buff items permanently,
- Structures to discover, 
- fortresses of stone-slots that you can break into,
- Set-piece: a little stronghold of cats
- Set-piece: a fortress with PRISM in the middle (Prism should be a UNIQUE item)
- A button that, when pressed, gives some big buff (EG: decreases round by 1)



- Made items that can't activate grayscale (need shader)

- CREATED NEW LEGENDARY ITEM: Chef's Knife: 
- On Level-Up: Spawns null-slots with food inside them. (KNIGHT shape)


- Create popup text saying "LEVEL {X} PASSED!"
- Play a cool sound when progressing to next level


- New item: Interdimensional-eye: Subtracts 50 Bonus, Earns +4 mult


- IDEA:
- Rare sack should have a 5% chance to spawn EPIC items
- Uncommon sack should have a 5% chance to spawn RARE items


DO THESE LATER: (They need to be spawned in a special position to work)
CURSE: Cursed purple balloon: On Buy, 30% chance to make purchased item DOOMED-5
CURSE: Cursed purple balloon: On Buy, 30% chance to make purchased item DOOMED-5
CURSE: Goblin glasses: When an item is purchased, steal $1 (QUEEN-3)
CURSE: Mushroom-wizard: 50% chance to spawn a Tentacle on a random empty-slot
CURSE: Tentacle: -50 points
CURSE: Cube slime: On Pulse: 30% chance to make a random item STUCK




ITEM:
Earns 30 points
If there are more than 3 curses alive, gain +10 points permanently


ITEM:
If touching at least 2 curses, give +20 points and -1 bonus to slots
(ROOK-8)


- Add "CURSE-CONTRACT":
cost: $25, deletes closest curse
