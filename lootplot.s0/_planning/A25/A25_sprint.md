## NEXT SPRINT::
## --------------

- Added 2 new DOOMED-10 items so the archetype isn't completely dead

- Created Grubby-ball, (G-ball) showcasing grubby-archetype

- Created achievement for grubby-ball


- Make items that can't activate grayscale (need shader)


- NEW LEGENDARY ITEM: Chef's Knife: 
- On Level-Up: Spawns null-slots with food inside them. (KNIGHT shape)


- Added 2 extra difficulties- bronze, silver, gold trophies (to implement, create a "DIFFICULTY" property)
trophies should spawn more or less curses (silver trophy, 1 curse per level) (gold trophy 2 curses per level)
And the points requirement should differ too
