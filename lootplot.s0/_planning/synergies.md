# Synergies and Emergence:

Synergies are VERY HARD to create.

Why?
Well, the trouble is that synergies aren't "created" directly by us.
Synergies emerge naturally when the systems interact.

So if we want to create synergies, we need to analyze our systems,
and try to create items that interact with the systems well.

## RAW IDEAS:
We need an item that interacts with DOOMED slots more.
- tooth-necklace: Dooms a slot, gives $4.
- **NEW**: gold tooth:  If slot is doomed, earn $2
- **NEW**: red tooth:  If slot is doomed, earn 15 points
