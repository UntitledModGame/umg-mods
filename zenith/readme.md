# zenith mod
VERSION 0.0


The Zenith mod is not a playable mod, nor is it a base mod.

`zenith` is used for testing of the UMG api, to ensure that nothing breaks
when doing big refactors.

NOTE: `zenith` does not test any of the base mods!!! It just tests
the UMG api itself.



Included in `zenith` is `lester`, a lua testing framework.

This can be used in other mods, since `zenith` exposes `lester` as a global.
