## Early-game changes:


- Remove/rework guppies (?)
**IDEA:**
Goldfish: Increases money by 10% (Max of $10)
Pointfish: Increases points by 20%
--- ^^^ ehhh, feels a bit "meh".  Not emergent.
    Doesnt add any value.
    Maybe we should just promote fish to RARE items.


- Buff stick  (+8 points?)

- Make Bone COMMON

- Remove cactus

- Make Net UNCOMMON (and make it blue!)
- Create New Multiplier-Net item  (RARE)

- Make leather UNCOMMON; remove money mult

- Quad dice: 
Remove GRUBBY from it
Buff to 50 points

- Trumpet: make UNCOMMON. Buff points

- Trumpet: make UNCOMMON. Buff points

- MINERAL items should all be promoted to UNCOMMON or RARE

- Make Spanner UNCOMMON

- (((DONE))) Make Rotation-balloon UNCOMMON 

- Make Coconut UNCOMMON


------

Rotation tool: Make it cost $0

Rotation slot: Add an `ACTIVATE` button; allowing people to rotate items during the round.
This would make stuff way better.
