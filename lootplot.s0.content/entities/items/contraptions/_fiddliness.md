Fiddliness; ie, giving the player more decisions, and more things to work with, is a great way of making a game feel "bigger".

That's why I wanna implement the action-button stuff;
Because it would add a lot of perceived depth/autonomy to lootplot.

"Fiddliness" is a concept in board games and it's usually meant as a pejorative, like: "This game is too fiddly." A fiddly board game has too many minor rules and edge cases to remember and/or too many different pieces that need to be moved around to track things. In other words, a fiddly game is one that lacks elegance in design.

In tabletop games, it makes sense that fiddliness would be seen as a bad thing - it's a medium that's built around face-to-face social interaction, where the rules need to be taught orally to the group and then tracked by human brains aided by physical cards and tokens. Elegance, the quality of having a few very intuitive, powerful rules, is how board games take the complexity out of rulekeeping so that players can focus on strategizing.

But in video games, the computer can manage so much of the fiddliness for us. An extra rule that causes headaches in a board game because it introduces a new chit to move around might go completely unnoticed in a video game. As a result, video game players actually value fiddliness, since they understand, at least subconsciously, that it's a byproduct of ambitious, freeform designs that enable them to DO MORE. Fiddly genres like strategy/tactics games, simulations, and management games are evergreen for this very reason.

Fiddliness is a contributor to bigness, as well: a small world that has a lot to do in it can feel bigger than a large world that is lacking in interactivity. Together, I think that these two concepts are the key to understanding how popular a genre is and how much room there is in the genre for more successful games. It's tempting, as a game designer, to focus too much on elegance in design because uncovering elegant rules feels, for lack of a better term, "designery". But unless other game developers are your primary audience, I would treat elegance as a means to an end and not the end itself. These days, if I had to choose between an elegant-but-restrictive solution and a janky-but-permissive solution, I'd lean toward picking the latter (all else being equal).
