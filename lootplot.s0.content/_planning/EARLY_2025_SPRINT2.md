## EARLY 2025 SPRINT TODO-LIST
------------
Hotfixes/balancing for our beta test.  
Round off the archetypes.
Touch ups for existing items; ensure emergence and depth.


## 17/JAN/2025 PARETO-PLANNING:

------------------------



- Point balancing. Make the game easier; its too oppressive right now.


- Have an end to the tutorial, (and maybe an exit-button?)

- Have mult in tutorial. 
(specifically; explain that putting mult BEFORE points is good!)

- Explain target-visuals in the tutorial


## NEBULOUS TASK: Planning for risk, planning for emergence.
--> Try to study the psychology of lootplot a lot more.
--> Analyze other games (backpack battles) and list what makes it fun.


- ITEM: Pulse 5 random slots.  (rarity: UNCOMMON)


- Destroy all shop-slots after LEVEL-10.
This prevents the player ruining the game for themselves.
