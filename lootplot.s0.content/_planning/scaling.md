## VALID WAYS TO SCALE:

- Increase money, use rings
- Level up items
- self-scaling items (moon-knife, helmet)

^^^ It's very 1-dimensional. we need better ways to scale!

----

## IDEAL SCALING:
- Very dynamic / hands-on:  
    - The player constantly has to keep doing stuff and adapting
- NOT REPETITIVE!!! (afk-scaling is not interesting!!!)
- Multiple ways to approach it
- Early-game items are still useful (somehow)
    - See SAP example; "when buy tier-1 unit, gain +1/1"
