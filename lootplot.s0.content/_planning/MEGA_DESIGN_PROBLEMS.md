# Excitement problem:  
The game feels too "samey".
Players are getting the same synergies late-game. 
When players get an epic combo/synergy, there is not really any excitement.  
We need to make items rarer, WITHOUT making the game boring. The player should always have things to do.

### PROPOSED SOLUTION(S): 
- Weak/Strong items: 
    - Weak items: kinda like resources/consumable items
    - Strong items: Very rare; hard to obtain (like Jokers in Balatro) but have impressive effects.
Weak items will provide the player with "something to do", and provide a way to build up the run more slowly.

- More Contraptions / Button-slots to use!
Since items are rarer, we want to give the player more stuff to do.
Contraptions / Button-slots will aid this

# Synergies problem:
There are not enough interesting synergies between items.  
I believe this is due to the *SYSTEMS* not accommodating the items enough.
(Compare this to "Best joker duos" in Balatro; where there are tonnes of different, open-ended synergies.)
Read [This comment section here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/balatro/comments/1cgxjx9/what_unique_jokers_would_you_give_to_the_ranks/)
As you can see, there are so many EASY ideas for new jokers.
This is because the systems are more "open", and there are more dimensions to work with.

### PROPOSED SOLUTION(S):
Perhaps we should add "Resources" to work with? 
- Items that consume resources
- Items that create/duplicate resources
- Items that need resources to function
AWESOME IDEA: What if resources could STACK??? Ie, you could have 10 units of "iron" on a singular slot?
