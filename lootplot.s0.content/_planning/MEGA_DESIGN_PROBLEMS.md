# Excitement problem:  
The game feels too "samey".
Players are getting the same synergies late-game. 
When players get an epic combo/synergy, there is not really any excitement.  
We need to make items rarer, WITHOUT making the game boring. The player should always have things to do.

### PROPOSED SOLUTION(S): 
- Weak/Strong items: 
    - Weak items: kinda like resources/consumable items
    - Strong items: Very rare; hard to obtain (like Jokers in Balatro) but have impressive effects.
Weak items will provide the player with "something to do", and provide a way to build up the run more slowly.

- More Contraptions / Button-slots to use!
Since items are rarer, we want to give the player more stuff to do.
Contraptions / Button-slots will aid this

# Synergies problem:
There are not enough interesting synergies between items.  
I believe this is due to the *SYSTEMS* not accommodating the items enough.
(Compare this to "Best joker duos" in Balatro; where there are tonnes of different, open-ended synergies.)
Read [This comment section here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/balatro/comments/1cgxjx9/what_unique_jokers_would_you_give_to_the_ranks/)
As you can see, there are so many EASY ideas for new jokers.
This is because the systems are more "open", and there are more dimensions to work with.

### PROPOSED SOLUTION(S):
Perhaps we should add "Resources" to work with? 
- Items that: consume resources, create/duplicate resources, 

^^^ Eh, I don't think this is good.
This adds good depth, but the depth is very much shoehorned in.  
Ideally; when adding deep-systems, we want stuff that is non-invasive; something that already serves a purpose.  
(Good examples of this:  `money` system. Or deck-system in Balatro)

### SYNERGIES SOLUTION:
It's in the *execution.* Just execute items well!   
There's not really any dogma behind it; just be pragmatic, and try to think of situations where the item would be really useful.

# RISK: 
I think one BIG thing that lootplot is missing, is risk.

I'm not talking about 1-dimensional risk, like: "50% chance to double money, 50% chance to lose all money".
I'm more so talking about nebulous risk.

A good example is deckbuilders.  
These games come with a huge amount of implicit risk-management-
"Will I draw the cards I need next turn?"   
And you can take actions to minimize the risk, or take more risks.

Risk makes the game more interesting. Instead of being like:
"Oh, that item is good- I want that item"
It's more like:
"Oh, that item could be good, IF our XYZ triggers".  
(Suppose that 20% of the cards in the deck have XYZ)  
All in all- It just adds a lot more depth to the game.  

## DIFFERENT TYPES OF "RISK":
**"Controlled" risk:**
Deckbuilders are a great example of "controlled" risk.  
Situations are sprung upon you;   
(ie you draw 6 random cards from your hand, and they are all bad.)   
All in all- even if you are dealt a bad hand of cards, you can still play.

**Un-controlled risk:**  
Examples of this:  
- Ballionaire
- Luck be a Landlord

**No risk:**
Games with no risk taking:  
- Lootplot
- Super auto pets
- Backpack battles / backpack hero
