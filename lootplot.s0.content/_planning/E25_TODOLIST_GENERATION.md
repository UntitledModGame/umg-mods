# NEBULOUS IDEAS FOR THE TODOLIST:
The TODOLIST should be kept concise, and *specific.*

Nebulous planning should be kept in this file instead.

## ITEM PLANNING SPIKE:

## DESTRUCTIVE ITEM PLANNING SPIKE:
-> More items that spawn junk-sticky-items
-> More items with `onDestroy` effect
---> Perhaps we need pink-shield? (Give lives to all items with Destroy trigger?)



## MORE REROLL-SCALING ITEMS:
Dont be scared to put extra triggers on items; 
Especially on scaling items.
We should have more scaling items with `trigger = {"PULSE", "REROLL"}`.
(That way, REROLL becomes a more viable build!!!)



## (((DONE))) More activation items!!!
It's quite hard to get a activator-build going.  
Back when we had octopi, this wasnt really a problem. But it just seems like now, there aren't enough activator items!!!  
IDEAS:
```
ITEM: Trigger Pulse on all target RARE/EPIC items 
^^^ (triggers={PULSE,REROLL})

ITEM: Trigger Pulse on all target COMMON/UNCOMMON items 
^^^ (triggers={PULSE,REROLL})

ITEM: Trigger Pulse on all items. (KING-2 shape)
(Cost $1 to activate)

ITEM: Trigger Pulse on all items (Queen-2 shape)  (STICKY)
```


## PLANNING SPIKE:
IN GENERAL: We need more items that cost money to use, or cost mana to use.
If we want money and mana to be a scarce resource, we NEED to offer ways for the player to use it.
==>>>
IDEA-1:
More consumable/food items that cost mana/money to use!
==>>>
IDEA-2:
In the weak-shop, when we randomly generate items, we should give some items a mana-cost, and reduce the items price by 2/3 (or something like that) 



## Change or rework treasure-sack items:
They are kinda... bad?? Idk. They feel very un-interactive...



- Item activation denial juice:
When an item fails activation, Big red cross animation?  
^^^ IDK, is it a good idea to have this?  
We already have it so the item shakes when it cant activate...





## PLANNING SPIKE:
Do something with the mineral-ring items.




## ITEM DESIGN METHODOLOGY:
When designing a new item, or trying to come up with a new synergistic item:
Read all the possible mechanics, in a list. That way, your mind will be more open.

grubby
mana
repeater
shape
random target? all targets? listener?
sticky/stuck
trigger
doomed
global money, points, mult
activations
rarity
destruction
price
reroll, level-up, pulse

Hopefully just reading through these will jog our minds, and make us a bit more creative
