## EARLY 2025 TODO-LIST
------------
Stuff to do/implement our beta-test.


## 10/JAN/2025 PARETO-PLANNING:
We need to get beta-release out ASAP.


------------


- (((DONE))) Rework iron shards (cloud-slot)


- (((DONE))) Make strong-shop-slots trigger on LEVEL-UP

- (((DONE))) Write blog-post detailing 2024 learning recap
- (((DONE))) Write document detailing what future-UMG would look like


- (((DONE))) Create coal shards
same as iron-shards, but NOT floating! Gives mult instead of points


- (((DONE))) Rework food shards


- (((DONE))) Put a juicy click and animation visual when clicking button-slots
    (The serverside-delay makes it feel unresponsive)


- (((DONE))) Remove `target.description` field, and refactor target descriptions


- (((DONE))) Grubby refactor  GRUB-X: Limits money to $X!


- (((DONE))) Update mana visuals


## ITEMS:


- (((DONE))) Simplify hammer items: 
"Earns X mult. Destroys a random target item"


- ITEM: Demonic loan: (refactor)
On Buy: Earn $25

(shape: VERTICAL-1)

- ITEM:
Multiplies points by -1. 
Adds 6 multiplier.

- ITEM:
Set multiplier to -30
Spawns steak items in UP-3 shape
(note: the way this works, is the steaks will offset the -30 mult, to give a net benefit. The player may also modify the shape for even more benefits/synergies)

- ITEM:
Lose 0.1 multiplier
Earn 20 points


- ITEM: Anvil:
Buff target items points-earned by the current mult (currently: X)

- ITEM: Sticky necklace:
Makes target slots STICKY, earns $2 for each slot.

- ITEM: Earn $1 for every target item that is STUCK

- ITEM: Increases price of all target items by $6 (Cost 1 mana)

## ITEM PLANNING SPIKE:
https://discord.com/channels/@me/698376055140122624/1321378894196117525






## PLANNING SPIKE:
Do something with the mineral-ring items.



## DESTRUCTIVE ITEM PLANNING SPIKE:
-> More items that spawn junk-sticky-items
-> More items with `onDestroy` effect
---> Perhaps we need pink-shield? (Give lives to all items with Destroy trigger?)



## MORE REROLL-SCALING ITEMS:
Dont be scared to put extra triggers on items; 
Especially on scaling items.
We should have more scaling items with `trigger = {"PULSE", "REROLL"}`.
(That way, REROLL becomes a more viable build!!!)



## PLANNING SPIKE:
IN GENERAL: We need more items that cost money to use, or cost mana to use.
If we want money and mana to be a scarce resource, we NEED to offer ways for the player to use it.
==>>>
IDEA-1:
More consumable/food items that cost mana/money to use!
==>>>
IDEA-2:
In the weak-shop, when we randomly generate items, we should give some items a mana-cost, and reduce the items price by 2/3 (or something like that) 



## Change or rework treasure-sack items:
They are kinda... bad?? Idk. They feel very un-interactive...



- Item activation denial juice:
When an item fails activation, Big red cross animation?  
^^^ IDK, is it a good idea to have this?  
We already have it so the item shakes when it cant activate...
