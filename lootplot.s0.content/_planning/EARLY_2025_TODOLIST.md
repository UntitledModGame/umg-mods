## EARLY 2025 TODO-LIST
------------
Stuff to do/implement our beta-test.



------------


- Rework iron shards (cloud-slot)


- Create coal shards
same as iron-shards, but NOT floating! Gives mult instead of points


- Rework food shards


- Put a juicy click and animation visual when clicking button-slots
(The serverside-delay makes it feel unresponsive)



- Simplify hammer items: 
"Earns X mult. Destroys a random target item"

- ITEM: Sticky necklace:
Makes target slots STICKY, earns $2 for each slot.
(Only works if the slot isnt already sticky!)

- FOOD ITEM:  Copies it's own target-shape to all target items.
(Currently: ROOK-1)
(Shape: ROOK-1)

- ITEM: Earn $1 for every target item that is STUCK

- ITEM: Increases price of all target items by $6 (Cost 1 mana)

- ITEM:
Gives mult equal to the number of lives that this item has
[Gives +1 mult]
(starts with 1 extra life)

- SLOT: Swashbuckler Slot:
Items placed on this slot dont cost any money to activate (And cannot earn money either!)

- ITEM: Swashbuckler apple: Creates a swashbuckler slot



## PLANNING SPIKE:
Do something with the mineral-ring items.


## PLANNING SPIKE:
IN GENERAL: We need more items that cost money to use, or cost mana to use.
If we want money and mana to be a scarce resource, we NEED to offer ways for the player to use it.
==>>>
IDEA-1:
More consumable/food items that cost mana/money to use!
==>>>
IDEA-2:
In the weak-shop, when we randomly generate items, we should give some items a mana-cost, and reduce the items price by 2/3 (or something like that)
