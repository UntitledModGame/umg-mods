## EARLY 2025 TODO-LIST
------------
Stuff to do/implement our beta-test.



------------


- (((DONE))) Rework iron shards (cloud-slot)


- (((DONE))) Make strong-shop-slots trigger on LEVEL-UP


- Make cloud-slots trigger BUY properly! (To work with balloons, etc)


- Create coal shards
same as iron-shards, but NOT floating! Gives mult instead of points


- Rework food shards


- Item activation denial juice:
When an item fails activation, Big red cross animation?



- Put a juicy click and animation visual when clicking button-slots
(The serverside-delay makes it feel unresponsive)


- Remove `target.description` field, and refactor target descriptions





## ITEMS:
- Simplify hammer items: 
"Earns X mult. Destroys a random target item"

- ITEM: Anvil:
Buff target items points-earned by the current mult (currently: X)

- ITEM: Golden potion:
Buff target item's points-generated by the current balance.
(Currently: $X)


- ITEM: Jar of gold:
Generates 5 points
Increases price by $1
(^^^ Maybe we should replace golden_watch with this? Make it simpler)


- ITEM: Sticky necklace:
Makes target slots STICKY, earns $2 for each slot.
(Only works if the slot isnt already sticky!)

- FOOD ITEM:  Copies it's own target-shape to all target items.
(Currently: ROOK-1)
(Shape: ROOK-1)

- ITEM: Earn $1 for every target item that is STUCK

- ITEM: Increases price of all target items by $6 (Cost 1 mana)

- ITEM:
Gives mult equal to the number of lives that this item has
[Gives +1 mult]
(starts with 1 extra life)

- SLOT: Swashbuckler Slot:
Items placed on this slot dont cost any money to activate (And cannot earn money either!)

- ITEM: Swashbuckler apple: Creates a swashbuckler slot



## ITEM PLANNING SPIKE:

## PLANNING SPIKE:
Do something with the mineral-ring items.



## DESTRUCTIVE ITEM PLANNING SPIKE:
-> More items that spawn junk-sticky-items
-> More items with `onDestroy` effect
---> Perhaps we need pink-shield? (Give lives to all items with Destroy trigger?)



## MORE REROLL-SCALING ITEMS:
Dont be scared to put "Bonus" or "Extra" triggers on items.
Especially on scaling items.
We should have more scaling items with `trigger = {"PULSE", "REROLL"}`.
(That way, REROLL becomes a more viable build!!!)



## PLANNING SPIKE:
IN GENERAL: We need more items that cost money to use, or cost mana to use.
If we want money and mana to be a scarce resource, we NEED to offer ways for the player to use it.
==>>>
IDEA-1:
More consumable/food items that cost mana/money to use!
==>>>
IDEA-2:
In the weak-shop, when we randomly generate items, we should give some items a mana-cost, and reduce the items price by 2/3 (or something like that) 



## Change or rework treasure-sack items:
They are kinda... bad?? Idk. They feel very un-interactive...
