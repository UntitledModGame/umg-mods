==--------------
(((DONE)))
- MINERAL items changes:
Swords changed to UNCOMMON/RARE
- Emerald tools: Get buffed on REROLL
- Axes: (target-items)
    - (Buffed every 4 activations)
- Spear items (give global mult?)
    - (Buffed every 3 activations?)
- Hammer-items (same as Axes; but with global-mult)
    - (Buffed every 8 activations)

NEW MINERAL TYPE: "Cobalt"
Cobalt needs 1 mana to scale. 
It has EXCELLENT base-points and scaling.
(Otherwise its identical to iron)
(((DONE)))
==--------------


- (((DONE))) Rework chubby-cat. Its currently too *non-emergent.*

- (((DONE))) Change key-balloon. It's garbage design.

- (((DONE))) Remove ALL uses of `mult-buff`. It's bad design!!!!

- Design new global mult-items 

------

Rotation tool: Make it cost $2 (max 3 activations)

Rotation slot: Add an `ACTIVATE` button; costing $2;
allowing people to rotate items during the round.
This would make stuff way better.

Change feather. It is currently non-emergent.

Create STICKY/STUCK components

Create food that converts STUCK --> STICKY

NEW MINERAL TYPE: "Quartz"
quartz has slightly stronger buffs, but is STICKY.

# Skahd feedback about new item ideas:
### TODO: Remove this, and put this elsewhere (maybe put inside trello?)

Item:
Earn money equal to the price of the cheapest item on the plot.
(will lose money if the price is negative!)
(currently: 2$)
--
"1st one is interesting, could scale well probably with a small enough plot"



Item:
If all target items are more expensive than $5, give +3 mult
(Current cheapest: $X)
--
"2nd is kinda meh, it's a constant value that seems arbitrary (talking about the $5, not the +3 mult), and also its anti-synergizing with shapes (probably intended), i would suggest something like "KING-SHAPE, if target item's price is higher than self's price, give +3 mult"



Item:
If there are no null-slots on the entire board, spawn food items.
(Current null-slot count: 0)
(shape=DOWN-2)
--
3 - spawn items to target are very broken (with pies), also its just directly null slot (probably fine actually, to force a build), maybe if it's "convert target items into food items" it would be more balanced



Jack of all:
if there are more than 12 unique slot types on the board, give +4 mult and earn 100 points
--
4 - by the time you have more than 12 unique slot types, addition to mults and points are weak, unless by changing the properties of the slots it can count as well




Item:
If the points requirement has been reached, give all target-items +6 points
--
5 - i don't think it's emergent



Item:
If the majority of target-items are DOOMED, earn $4. Else, lose 1$.
(STICKY)
--
6 - good idea, with the sticky too it makes them have to think about the placement too..



Item:
If all target items are the same rarity, give +2 mult, and earn $2
(shape=KING + ROOK-4)
--
7 - fine idea, you'd prolly try to put it as far away as other items, but also it kinda forces you to stay with a "tier" of item, which works with the current shop refactor i guess, but the effects are small compared to the requirement
