- Make an item that infinitely spawns dirt-slots
(ie isn't doomed!!! Shape UP-1, rarity=EPIC)


- MINERAL items changes:
Swords changed to UNCOMMON/RARE
- Mineral items (Especially swords) are self-buffing.
    - Emerald tools: Get buffed on REROLL
- Axes changed (target-empty slots ONLY)
    - (Buffed every 4 activations)
- Hammer-items (same as Axes; but target items. Shape=ROOK-1)
    - (Buffed every 2 activations)
- Scythe items (give global mult?)


NEW MINERAL TYPE: "Cobalt"
Cobalt needs 1 mana to activate. 
It has EXCELLENT base-points and scaling.
(Otherwise its identical to iron)

NEW MINERAL TYPE: "Copper"
Copper has GRUB-cap. (Other than that; same as iron)


- Change key-balloon. It's garbage design.

- Mult-items designing

------

Rotation tool: Make it cost $2 (max 3 activations)

Rotation slot: Add an `ACTIVATE` button; costing $2;
allowing people to rotate items during the round.
This would make stuff way better.
