## E25 SPRINT CHECKLIST:

A couple of small checks to keep us on target:



## CHECK-1:
Is the game *FUN?*
Is it balanced well for newbies?
(Doesn't matter if the game itself is unbalanced)



## CHECK-2:
Is the player able to make strategic decisions?
Are there sufficient deep synergies to pick between?



## CHECK-3:
Are you adhering to 80/20 rule?
