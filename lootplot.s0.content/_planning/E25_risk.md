## EARLY-2025 PREDICTABLE-RISK DESIGN DOCUMENT.


(BEFORE YOU READ THIS: 
Read the portion on `RISK` in the MEGA_DESIGN_PROBLEMS.md file.)

----

Lootplot having more *risk* and *variance* would be very beneficial.  
If we can achieve this; it'd be amazing.

DECKBUILDER EXAMPLE:
```
Instead of being like:
"Oh, that item is good- I want that item"
It's more like:
"Oh, that item could be good, IF our XYZ triggers".  
(Suppose that 20% of the cards in the deck have XYZ)  
```

^^^ all in all, it just adds a tremendous amount of depth.


## Unrefined brainstorming:
- Instead of PULSE-BUTTON pulsing everything, pulse items randomly.
(like, 50% of items?)

- What if PULSing was done via dragging stuff on top of other items?  
The "quality" and "shape" of the pulse is dependent on the thing you dragged.  
Could be many different "types" of Pulsers?

- Maybe we don't need variance in PULSING?  
Maybe we need variance in other areas....

- Consider SAP. There isnt weird, deckbuilding mechanics in that game.  
It's all super simple!!  SAP adds variance through the shop itself.
