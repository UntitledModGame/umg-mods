## EARLY-2025 PREDICTABLE-RISK DESIGN DOCUMENT.


(BEFORE YOU READ THIS: 
Read the portion on `RISK` in the MEGA_DESIGN_PROBLEMS.md file.)

----

Lootplot having more *risk* and *variance* would be very beneficial.  
If we can achieve this; it'd be amazing.

DECKBUILDER EXAMPLE:
```
Instead of being like:
"Oh, that item is good- I want that item"
It's more like:
"Oh, that item could be good, IF our XYZ triggers".  
(Suppose that 20% of the cards in the deck have XYZ)  
```

^^^ all in all, it just adds a tremendous amount of depth.



## OLI THOUGHTS:
I think it's hard to add "risk" to lootplot in a systemic way.  

Instead, we should focus on the execution.
Add risk via the items:
EG:  
- Golden-horseshoe: 50% chance to double money, 50% chance to lose it.
- Treasure-bags:
