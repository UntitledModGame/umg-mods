# Warning: OLD.

All of this stuff is what's left of the holdables mod.
It has been conglomerated, in case we need to refer 
to it in the future.

If you want to see what the holdables mod looked like in full BEFORE the refactor, see commit:
18580688aee9e679acf91c7b692c07ec83adc59a

----

## Future:
In the future, the `holdables` mod will extend from the `execution` mod, and the `attachment` mod.
