# Dimension groups:


### IDEA 1:
Downside of this idea:
We gotta define `onAdded` and `onRemoved` for every dimension
individually... which is terrible.
```lua

local groups = dimensions.groups("x", "y")

umg.on("@update", function()
    for _, dimensionGroup in ipairs(groups) do
        for _, ent in ipairs(dimensionGroup) do
            updateEnt(ent)
        end
    end
end)
```


### IDEA 2:
We create an abstract group object that represents all dimensions at once:
```lua
local group = dimensions.group("x", "y")

group:onAdded(function(ent)
    local dim = self:getDimension() -- "overworld"
end)

group:onRemoved(function(ent)
    local dim = self:getDimension() -- "overworld"
end)
```
Downside: We can't *really* iterate over this data structure.





# Dimension events:
We want to easily be able to isolate events per dimension.
Example, `explosion` event only happens in one dimension.

Note that this could also just be achieved by passing the dimension
into the event, like:
```lua
umg.call("explosion", "overworld", ...)
```
We want to do better.

### IDEA 1:
```lua
local dim = dimensions.getDimensionObject(ent)

dim:call("explosion", ...)
-- same for umg.ask
```
But this is kinda bad....





## IDEA 3:
We don't need anything fancy. Instead, we leave implementation details up
to the modder.

(So that includes passing in the dimension to `umg.call` events.)
```lua

dimensions.onAny("drawEntity", function(dimension, ...)

end)

```







## IDEA 4:
Scrap all previous ideas.
We don't need anything fancy;
dimensions are just the same as (x,y) position; and we don't really
have anything fancy for x,y.


## Design considerations:
What happens if an entity is moved to a non-existant dimension?
- The dimension is automatically created.




## CONFIRMED API:
Stuff that definitely makes sense to include:
```lua

dimensions.server.setDimension(ent, "new_dim")
-- Moves ent to "new_dim"

local dim = dimensions.getDimension(ent) -- "new_dim"
local dim = dimensions.getDimension(ent.dimension) -- same thing



dimensions.server.setDefaultDimension("overworld")
-- If entities aren't assigned a dimension, they will end up here.
local dim = dimensions.getDefaultDimension() -- "overworld"


local my_dim = dimensions.server.generateUniqueDimension("name") 
-- generates a new unique dimension name containing the word "name",
-- like `name_30948945845` or something.  Great for temporary dimensions.


dimensions.exists(dim) -- true/false, whether `dim` exists as a dimension


local arr = dimensions.getAllDimensions() -- gets all dimensions



umg.on("dimensions:entityMoved", function(ent, oldDim, newDim)
    ... -- called when an entity moves dimensions
end)

umg.on("dimensions:dimensionCreated", function(dim_name)
    ... -- Called when a new dimension is created
end)

umg.on("dimensions:dimensionDestroyed", function(dim_name)
    ... -- called when a dimension is destroyed
end)

```




## How other mods should do stuff
```lua
weather.rain.setOptions(dim, {...})
weather.fog.setOptions(dim, {...})

rendering.setGroundTextures(dim,  {"tex1", ...})

light.setBaseLighting(dim,  {1,1,1})
light.setDayNightCycle(dim, {
    ...
})

```




### Option 1:
setters/getters for `ent.dimension`

PROS:
easier for dimensions mod to reason about
able to have callbacks for when an entity changes dimensions
efficient, since systems know when an ents dimension changes

CONS:
modders might forget to use getters
harder to reason about, feels more janky
potential for a desync between ent.dimension and it's actual dimension

### Option 2:
no setters/getters for `ent.dimension`

PROS:
more consistent with x,y. x,y positions don't use setters/getters
easier to understand
more bug resistant

CONS:
systems don't know when dimension changes

### BEST OPTION:

- no getters/setters
- dimensions mod automatically emits `dimensions:entityMoved`
    if an entity moves.











# question:
Should dimensions have an actual representation?
(like, as an object?)
Or should they just be ids?

### OPTION 1:
Dimensions don't actually exist, they are just string tags

PROS:
- more robust
- dont need to handle deletion/creation of dimensions

CONS:
- can't detect when a dimension is destroyed/created (no callbacks)


### OPTION 2:
Dimensions are kept track of by the dimensions mod

PROS:
- dimensionCreated and dimensionDestroyed callback are available
- can iterate over dimensions
- way better for chunk saving

CONS:
- less robust, error prone.
- Somehow need to handle deletion / creation of dimensions

*To better explore opt 2, we need to answer a few questions:*
- what happens if an entity goes to a non-existant dimension?
    - the dimension is created
- if no entities exist in a dimension, what happens to the dimension?
    - we could add an option to automatically delete dimensions that dont
        contain any entities?
- how do we detect if no entities exist in a dimension?
    - perhaps the dimension mod could keep track of an entity count per dimension for us? (This is free, since we already keep track of entities moving dimensions)









# question B:
How are dimensions persisted to disk?

IDEA: `overseeingDimension` component.
This component signifies that this entity owns/controls this dimension.

That way, when we mutate dimensions, we can simply change the 
components within the controller entity.

This is a great idea, because dimension properties will be automatically
propagated to clients when they join the server.
None of that needs to be done manually.


If this entity is deleted, then the dimension is also deleted.
(e.g. if portal to a dimension is deleted, the dimension is also deleted)


Question:
what happens if we want 2 entities as dimensionOverseers?
i.e. two portals pointing to the same dimension...?
A: ^^^ this shouldn't be possible. It would overcomplicate things.

-------

With this setup, we could write code like so:
```lua
function lighting.setBaseLighting(dim, color)
    strTc(dim)
    local ent = spatial.getDimensionOverseer(dim)
    if ent then
        ent.baseLighting = color
        sync.syncComponent(ent, "dimensionLighting")
    end
end
```
