Components:
```lua

ent.conductive = true -- this entity can conduct pulse


ent.pulse = X -- how much pulse this entities carries this tick


-- Conductive properties:
ent.resistance = 1 -- how effective this entity is at conducting
-- (default = 1)
-- A negative value implies that the entity magnifies the pulse

ent.reactance = 1 -- how often this entity can conduct pulses
-- (default = 1)



```
