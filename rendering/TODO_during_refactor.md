# stuff to do during refactor:


- Look through rendering's newly created `constants`, check that none 
    of the constants are being used in the base mod.

- look through base_exports for rendering stuff.
    - check for requires of moved files.
    - check for usages of `base.client.<moved_thing>`


Then test!
