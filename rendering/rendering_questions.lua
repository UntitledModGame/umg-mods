    MODDER, BEWARE!!!!

    These questions below are asked very frequently.
    (Specifically, they are asked every time we draw an entity.)

    Do NOT include complex code in your answers!!!
    Every answer should be a fast, simple O(1) check.

    Also, try to not answers questions like these *too* many times,
    as it will cause a slight performance hit.
