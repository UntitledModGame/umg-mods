# The UI Problem



# Rendering and UI:
Ok. We have a *bit* of a problem with UI, rendering, and lootplot in general.

We want to be able to swap items easily between UI <--> World-plot.
This would be GREAT with inventories.... BUT.. that would mean that we
need to render an inventory *into the world.*

Likewise, another big issue is that with UI elements, we can't *really*
use juice-entities very well.
