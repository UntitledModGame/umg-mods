# Slot
Slots live in `Plot`s.

A Slot is like a container for an item to exist in.
Can be placed in the world; but also exist within inventories.



Important things to note:
- `Slot`s CANNOT be moved out of a `Plot`.
    - They can only be deleted/augmented.

- How are items moved between Plots?
    - They aren't. Items are moved between `Slot`s.




## Types of Slots:
Reroll slots:
    Reroll the item when triggered
Shop slots:
    Items in these slots can be purchased

Golden / Blue / Red slots:
    (Have other special effects. TODO)

Dead slots:
    Items in these slots do not activate.
    By default; all shops, inventories, and stuff have "Dead" slots.
