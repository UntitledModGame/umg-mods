# INTUITIVE THEMING:

Ideally, players should be granted an indication of what an entity does based on how it looks.
This file serves as planning for this kind of theming.

-----

# IDEATION:


Fruit/food items: 
- Consumable items

Potion items:
- Consumable items that are POWERFUL/RULEBENDER

Dark items:
- Related to death somehow

Plant items:
- Related to spawning / growth

Yellow/golden coloured items:
- Related to money somehow

Armor (chestplate/leggings) items:
- Related to creating/destroying/modifing slots

Glove items:
- Related to changing/interfacing with shapes

Helmet items:
- Useless on their own
- Will always interact with other items heavily.
    - (IE: Works well with shapes!)



# Rulebender items:
Generally these items should be very unique, since their effects are also very unique as well.
