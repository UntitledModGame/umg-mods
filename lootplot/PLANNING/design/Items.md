# Items 
Items are the CORE of lootplot.

Items live in `Plot`s.
Generally, items can't exist without a slot.


----

## Two types:

### Consumable items
Consumable items, when swapped, will instead “combine” with the other item.
This will affect on the other item that it was combined with.
(These items will be a onetime use)
```
Dagger:
Combine -> Destroys target item

Spanner:
Combine -> Gives clockwork trait to target item

[blah blah]:
Combine -> Gives [some buff] to target item
```


### Normal items:
These are just normal.
